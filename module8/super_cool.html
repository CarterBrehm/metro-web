		<p>Welcome to Supah Cool Industries. The goal of this web site is to
			provide you with up-to-date information about all the Supah Cool things we
			do. We like to make logos, especially in blue and orange. We like to start
			the day with coffee and end it with a nice red wine. We like to make
			photos, especially of memorable images. We travel when we can to talk to
			other Supah Cool Industry groups around the world. We prefer meeting in
			places such as Hawaii, Greece, and off the coast of Spain. We probably
			don't sell a lot of stuff, but we are supah cool, which is really all that
			matters to us, anyway. 
		</p>
		<p>If you are interested in joining up with Supah Cool
			Industries, you'll want to check the employment page. Which we haven't put
			up just yet. We think our webmaster went to the donut shop, but we're not
			quite sure.
